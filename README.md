** This Mod is not supported by dwallorde, or anyone. It's a Proof of Concept Only Play **

A base mod of dwallorde's War of the Walkers, as synced from the 7D2D Mod Launcher. 

Using SDX 0.7.2, and the SDX Mod Helper, SDX elements were added and intermingled to provide a unique play experience. 
The SDX Mod Helper downloaded the SDX mods, and updated the localization files, removing bad entries and adding references to which workstations
are to be used for crafting.

Xtrackickin's Zombie Enhancement was added as a 7D2D Patch, generated and applied with the 7D2D Mod Launcher adds a more versatile element.
